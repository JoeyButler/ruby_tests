<title>ODEP launches media campaign encouraging youth with disabilities to pursue career goals</title>
<description>To help millions of people recognize what they can do to make a difference in the lives - and future careers - of young people with disabilities, the U.S. Department of Labor's Campaign for Disability Employment has released a new video public service announcement titled "Because." The PSA features real people with disabilities - not actors - who are pursuing and realizing their goals and passions as a result of the support they received from everyday people in their lives.

<title>Statement by Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis on the death of Lucille Beserra Roybal</title>
<description>I have always believed that public service is a 'family affair.' No one exemplified that more than Lucille Beserra Roybal, the wife of the late Congressman Edward Ross Roybal, and mother of Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard. Although she worked tirelessly behind the scenes with her husband and daughter while in the U.S. Congress, Mrs. Roybal made important contributions to the community in her own right. She co-founded the Community Service Organization in California, registered voters throughout Los Angeles and reached out to underserved communities on behalf of local public health and charitable organizations. </description>
